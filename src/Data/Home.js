Rightfully it is so. 1300 kms away from the main land, in between the ocean, swimming is not the option. Spend time seeing the architecture and the way prisoners were treated. After seeing this place to your contempt, head towards Corbyns Cove Beach, one of the attractive beaches in Port Blair. Indulge in some water sports there. Jet skie or a speed boat ride & parasailing to snake island will thrill you. In the evening return to the cellular jail to see the light and sound show.

    ques: "How is the mobile network and connectivity in the Andaman Islands?",
    ans: "Mobile network and connectivity in the Andaman Islands can be spotty and inconsistent. In Port Blair, the capital, and some  popular tourist spots like Havelock Island, you'll generally find decent coverage, especially with major Indian telecom providers like BSNL, Airtel, and Jio. However, as you move to more remote areas or smaller islands, the signal can weaken, and internet speeds may drop significantly. It's a good idea to plan for limited connectivity, especially if you're heading to less populated places.",
