    { image: frame1, title: "Cellular Jail" , content:"The construction of Cellular Jail started in 1896 and completed in 1906. Spread as seven spokes of a bicycle wheel, this unique three-storied structure was the first of its kind in India as it had 693 cells specially built for solitary confinement of the prisoners. Extraordinary feature of the Jail was the total absence of communication between prisoners housed in different wings since the front of the row of cells faced the back of the other. A two-storied building at left side near the entrance of the Jail was constructed to be used as Jail hospital. On the plinth of this building now stands the Martyr's Column. Near the compound wall at right of the main entrance is the gallows where three persons could be executed simultaneously with a separate door in the outer compound wall to carry our corpses. Many charismatic freedom fighters were imprisoned in this Jail. Savarkar brothers, Hotilal Verma, Babu Ram Hari, Pandit Parmanand, Ladha Ram, Ullaskar Dutt, Barin Kumaar Ghosh, Bhai Parmanand, Indu Bhushan Roy, Prithvi Singh Azad, Pulin Das, Trailokyanath Chakravarthy, Gurumukh Singh, etc. were incarcerated here among others.

A number of them were sent to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Island. Gradually various Govt. functionaries and their residences including that of Chief Commissioner known as Govt. house came up. The Island became the citadel to rule the Penal Settlement of Andamans. During the severe earthquake of 26th June 1941, much damage was caused to the buildings. Subsequently the Japanese occupational forces in World War II demolished a number of buildings on the Island. On 18th April 1979, the Island was transferred to the Defence Ministry. The Island has become a hot tourist spot today to view the ruins, and savour the glory of the bygone days.

To keep alive the vibes of the past Navy has setup a museum 'Smritika - The Ross Memorial'." },

In the wake of World War II, most of the British left the Islands. With the Japanese occupation on 23rd March 1942, the unarmed India Penal Settlers / Islanders came under their control. Those patriots organised the Indian Independence League (IIL) and INA for participation in the freedom struggle movement. During the war, the British landed their spies in Andamans whose espionage activities caused heavy damage to the Japanese. The Japanese retaliated with brutal tortures against the locals which continued for months. Seven islanders were shot dead on 30th March 1943 at Dugnabad sea shore. On 30th January 1944, Japanese took away 44 IIL members from the Cellular Jail to the village Humfraygunj on a hillock, shot dead and buried all the 44 members in an 'L' shaped mass grave. In commemoration of those martyrs' supreme sacrifice Balidan Vedi has been erected." },
